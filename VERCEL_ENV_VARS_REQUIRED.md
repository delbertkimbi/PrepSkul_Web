# 🔐 Required Environment Variables for Vercel Deployment

## ❌ **Current Status: Missing Critical Variables**

You mentioned you only have **AGORA_APP_ID** and **AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE** in Vercel. However, **these are NOT sufficient** for the recording and transcription features to work.

---

## ✅ **Required Environment Variables**

### **1. Agora Cloud Recording (REQUIRED)**
```env
AGORA_APP_ID=your_app_id                    # ✅ You have this
AGORA_CUSTOMER_ID=your_customer_id           # ❌ MISSING - CRITICAL!
AGORA_CUSTOMER_SECRET=your_customer_secret   # ❌ MISSING - CRITICAL!
```

**Why these are needed:**
- `AGORA_APP_ID`: Used to identify your Agora app
- `AGORA_CUSTOMER_ID`: Required for Cloud Recording API authentication
- `AGORA_CUSTOMER_SECRET`: Required for Cloud Recording API authentication

**Note:** `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` is **NOT** used for Cloud Recording. It's only used for generating tokens in the Flutter app.

---

### **2. Deepgram Transcription (REQUIRED)**
```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-api-key      # ❌ MISSING - CRITICAL!
```

**Why this is needed:**
- Required for transcribing audio files after recording

---

### **3. Supabase (Should already exist)**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url  # ✅ Should already exist
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key  # ✅ Should already exist
```

---

## 🔍 **What Each Variable Is Used For**

### **AGORA_APP_ID**
- Used in: `AgoraClient` constructor
- Purpose: Identifies your Agora application
- Used for: All Agora API calls (acquire, start, stop recording)

### **AGORA_CUSTOMER_ID**
- Used in: `AgoraClient` constructor

- Purpose: Authentication for Cloud Recording API
- Used for: Basic Auth header (`customerId:customerSecret`)

### **AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE**
- Used in: `token-generator.ts` (Flutter app token generation)
- Purpose: Signing tokens for Flutter app to join channels
- **NOT used in:** Cloud Recording API (uses Customer ID/Secret instead)

### **DEEPGRAM_API_KEY**
- Used in: `DeepgramClient` constructor
- Purpose: Authentication for Deepgram transcription API
- Used for: Transcribing audio files

## 🔍 **Verification**

After adding the variables, check your Vercel deployment logs for:

✅ **Success indicators:**
- No errors about missing environment variables
- Recording API calls succeed (check `/api/agora/recording/start` logs)
- Transcription API calls succeed (check webhook logs)

❌ **Failure indicators:**
- "Missing required Agora credentials" errors
- "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY environment variable is required" errors
- 401 Unauthorized errors from Agora API

## 📝 **Summary**

**You need to add to Vercel:**
1. ✅ `AGORA_APP_ID` - Already have
2. ✅ `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` - Already have (but not used for recording)
3. ❌ `AGORA_CUSTOMER_ID` - **MISSING - ADD THIS!**
4. ❌ `AGORA_CUSTOMER_SECRET` - **MISSING - ADD THIS!**
5. ❌ `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` - **MISSING - ADD THIS!**

**Without these 3 missing variables, recording and transcription will NOT work.**
